## Template Method

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

### When to use it
* When you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
* When you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences.
