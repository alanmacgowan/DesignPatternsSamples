## Visitor

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### When to use it
* When you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
* To clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
* When a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.
