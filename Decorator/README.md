## Decorator

Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### When to use it
* When you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
* When it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.
